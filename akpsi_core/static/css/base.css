/*
One of the core goals with styling that I have is to make everything as
accesible as possible from the beginning.

So, the base font size is gonna be 10px, and everything will be scaled from
there.

So if you need to re-size something, use the 'em' sizing. 'em' is a multiple
of the root font-size. So with a base of 10px, 2em would be 20 pixels. The
benefit being that if users have scaling enabled in their browser due to
vision issues, our app will scale to that automatically.

Also, all links and images MUST contain alt-text.
