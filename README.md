# Alpha Kappa Psi - Beta Chi

## General Information

## Required Software
- The application is built for Windows (and, in part, requires Windows environment variables), but should work on Mac.
- For development, it uses MySQL server as it's database.
- Uses Python 3.7.1, all other package versions are in the requirements file. 
    - I recommend installing python through Anaconda.

## Apps
Django breaks projects into sub categories called Apps. It's a convenient way to break up logic/urls into logical containers. 

#### akpsi_core
This is the core of the application (hence the name), it contains the bulk of the code/connections for the central database of the chapter. 

#### points
This is the app for members tracking their points in the current semester. It should also allow appropriate officers to update points for members, and Pres/EVP/VPM to override those.
